/usr/local/mysql/bin is not in the default $PATH. $PATH is the list of directories that are searched when you try to use an executable without specifying a complete path.

You either need to use the full path (/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_executable_here) or add it to your $PATH:

export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin"
You can add this line to a file called .profile in your home directory to execute it each time you create a new shell:

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin"' >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
